        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Zee — a developer, and lifelong learner dedicated to making programming accessible. I believe everyone should be able to build tools, solve problems, and understand the logic behind the apps and systems we use every day.</p>
        <p>Through hands-on projects and structured Q&A lessons, I’m here to help you go from “I’ve never coded before” to “I just built my first app!”</p>

  <h2>About Learn Programming With Zee</h2>
  <p><strong>Learn Programming With Zee</strong> is an independent digital learning initiative built for clarity, curiosity, and confidence. It is not a registered business or institution—just a community-focused project aiming to make programming easy and accessible for everyone.</p>
  <p>Instead of long tutorials, we focus on short, practical questions and answers—so you can learn exactly what you need, when you need it. The platform is designed around real-life analogies, visual explanations, and clean, simple steps. No jargon, no fluff—just programming that makes sense.</p>

  <details class="qa-block">
    <summary>Q: What is programming?</summary>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Programming</strong> is the art and science of giving instructions to a computer so it can perform specific tasks. These tasks can range from adding two numbers to building interactive websites, mobile apps, or intelligent systems.</p>

      <p>Think of programming like **writing a recipe** for a machine. If you want it to bake a cake, you must describe every step: gather ingredients, mix, bake, cool, decorate. A computer can’t "guess" what you mean—it needs everything explained with precision.</p>

      <h4>🧠 Why is it useful?</h4>
      <p>Programming gives us the power to create tools, automate work, solve problems, and turn ideas into digital experiences. It’s behind everything from calculators and banking systems to search engines and video games.</p>

      <h4>🔄 Programming connects data to actions</h4>
      <p>At its core, programming is about taking **data** (like a user's name, a temperature, or a button press) and using logic to decide **what happens next**. It tells the computer how to react.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📥 If the user types their name, display a greeting.</li>
        <li>📈 If the temperature rises, activate the fan.</li>
        <li>✅ If the quiz score is over 80, show “Well done!”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This interaction is what makes apps feel “smart.” The user sees visuals (text, buttons, feedback), but behind the scenes, the program is constantly thinking: <em>“What’s the data? What should I do with it?”</em></p>

      <h4>🔧 Analogy: Programming is like building a vending machine</h4>
      <p>A vending machine responds to input (money + button press) and gives an output (a snack!). The logic inside decides what to do when certain buttons are pressed, and how to respond if there’s not enough credit. That’s programming—it connects inputs to outputs using logic.</p>

      <h4>🚀 In short:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming is a way to describe instructions</strong> that a machine can carry out.</li>
        <li><strong>It transforms data into action</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>It allows us to build anything from a calculator to a chatbot</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And just like any language, the more you practice, the more fluently you can express your ideas—and the more powerful the tools you can build.</p>

  <h2>Data</h2>

  <details class="qa-block">
    <summary>Q: How does data relate to programming?</summary>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Data</strong> is at the heart of programming. It’s the raw material that programs work with—facts, values, input from users, sensor readings, or results of calculations. Without data, programs would have nothing to process or respond to.</p>

      <h4>📦 Analogy: A Program is a Kitchen, Data is the Ingredients</h4>
      <p>Think of a program like a kitchen and data as the ingredients. The recipes (code) say what to do—boil, mix, bake—but without ingredients (data), nothing meaningful can be made.</p>

      <h4>💡 Where does data come from?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>📥 User input – typing a name, selecting a product</li>
        <li>⏳ System info – current time, file size</li>
        <li>🌐 External sources – data from websites, spreadsheets</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>📍 Where is data stored during a program’s lifetime?</h4>
      <p>When a program runs, it stores data in **variables** (temporary containers in memory). These variables last only while the program is active—once it closes, the data disappears unless it's saved elsewhere.</p>

      <pre><code>Dim score As Integer = 90 ' score lives while the program runs</code></pre>

      <h4>💾 How do we keep data after the program ends?</h4>
      <p>This is called <strong>data persistence</strong>. We save the data to an external file or service so it’s available the next time the program runs. Common options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Text Files:</strong> Save simple lines of data like logs, scores, or configs.</li>
        <li><strong>Spreadsheets:</strong> Great for tabular data—like quiz results or inventories.</li>
        <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Powerful for storing large, structured datasets (like users, purchases, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>📘 Example: Saving a Quiz Score</h4>
      <p>Let’s say a user scores 8 out of 10 in a quiz. If we don’t store it, the result is lost when the program closes. But if we write it to a file:</p>
      <pre><code>File.WriteAllText("score.txt", "Latest Score: 8/10")</code></pre>
      <p>Now that score can be opened later—even if the app was closed!</p>

      <h4>🧠 In Summary:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data powers the decision-making</strong> in programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Variables hold data temporarily</strong> while a program runs.</li>
        <li><strong>Files, spreadsheets, or databases persist data</strong> after the program exits.</li>
      </ul>
